This web-based application allows users to create accounts, add their own recipes, like and delete comments, search for recipes, and watch embedded YouTube videos. The site provides features for users to manage and share their culinary creations with a community.

In developing this application, I demonstrated proficiency in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React.JS, Node.JS, MongoDB, JWT, and RESTful methods to create a robust frontend design, client-side validations, and the API framework.

Key contributions:

API Development: Constructed a RESTful API for managing user accounts, recipes, and comments, integrating a recipe API for comprehensive recipe management.
Back-End Server: Developed a Node.js server to handle requests, process data, and serve content efficiently.
CI/CD Integration: Deployed the application using a CI/CD pipeline through Render, ensuring continuous integration and deployment.
Testing: Implemented a testing strategy to ensure code reliability and performance.
Authentication and Security: Implemented robust authentication and security measures using JWT tokens and the Bcrypt library to protect user data.
Frontend Development: Designed accessible, dynamic, and responsive user interfaces using Vite, React, HTML wireframes, CSS styling, and JavaScript to enhance user experience.
User Interactions: Enabled users to like and delete comments on recipes, fostering a more interactive and engaging community experience.
Search Functionality: Developed a search feature allowing users to easily find recipes based on keywords or ingredients.
Multimedia Integration: Integrated the ability for users to watch embedded YouTube videos within recipes, providing a rich multimedia experience.
